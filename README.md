# ToDo - React

A simple implementation of a To Do application developed using React.js and Bootstrap.

## Getting started

Configuring this repository to get going is extremely simple.

Assuming you already have installed Node and npm (if you don't, [check how to here](https://nodejs.org/en/)), all you'll need to do is:

* Open the terminal in the root folder of the project

* Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

* Get your Mongo.db running (to install mongo locally, check [this page](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/administration/install-community/))
```
mongod --port 27017
```

* In another terminal instance, get node running. It's important that you have mongo running before node.
```
npm start
```

* Check the app in your browser on localhost:3000
